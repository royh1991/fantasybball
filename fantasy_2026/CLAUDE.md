## How the Simulation Works

### Step 1: Load Actual Game Data

```python
# Load box scores (actual Week 6 results)
box_scores = pd.read_csv('data/matchups/box_scores_latest.csv')
week6_data = box_scores[box_scores['week'] == 6]

# Extract players and game counts for each team
# Example: Stephen Curry played 3 games in Week 6
home_players = {
    'Stephen Curry': 3,
    'Austin Reaves': 3,
    'Kawhi Leonard': 2,
    ...
}
```

### Step 2: Fit Player Models

```python
# Load historical game logs (2019-2024)
historical = pd.read_csv('data/historical_gamelogs/historical_gamelogs_latest.csv')

# Fit Bayesian model for each player
model = FantasyProjectionModel(evolution_rate=0.5)
model.fit_player(historical, 'Stephen Curry')

# Model learns player's shooting percentages, counting stats, variance
# Uses empirical Bayes shrinkage for uncertainty quantification
```

### Step 3: Simulate Games

```python
# For each of 500 simulations:
for sim in range(500):
    # Simulate each player's actual games
    for player, n_games in home_players.items():
        for game in range(n_games):
            # Sample from player's posterior distribution
            game_stats = model.simulate_game()
            # game_stats = {'PTS': 28, 'REB': 7, 'AST': 9, ...}

            # Aggregate to team totals
            team_totals['PTS'] += game_stats['PTS']
            team_totals['REB'] += game_stats['REB']
            # etc.
```

### Step 4: Calculate Category Winners

```python
# Compare teams across all 11 categories
categories = {
    'FG%': team_a_fgm/team_a_fga vs team_b_fgm/team_b_fga,
    'FT%': team_a_ftm/team_a_fta vs team_b_ftm/team_b_fta,
    '3P%': team_a_3pm/team_a_3pa vs team_b_3pm/team_b_3pa,
    'PTS': team_a_pts vs team_b_pts,
    # etc.
}

# Count wins: team with 6+ categories wins the matchup
team_a_cats = 7
team_b_cats = 4
winner = 'Team A'
```

### Step 5: Aggregate Results

```python
# After 500 simulations:
team_a_wins = 425
team_b_wins = 62
ties = 13

# Win probability
team_a_win_pct = 425 / 500 = 0.85 (85%)
team_b_win_pct = 62 / 500 = 0.124 (12.4%)
```

## Player Modeling Details

The simulation uses `FantasyProjectionModel` from `/Users/rhu/fantasybasketball2/weekly_projection_system.py`:

### Bayesian Framework
- **Shooting percentages**: Beta-Binomial conjugate model
  - Prior: Position-specific league averages
  - Posterior: Updated with recent games (exponential decay)
  - Simulation: `p ~ Beta(α, β)`, then `makes ~ Binomial(attempts, p)`

- **Counting stats**: Poisson model
  - Rate parameter λ estimated from recent games
  - Recency weighting: decay_factor=0.9 over last 10 games
  - Simulation: `stat ~ Poisson(λ)`

- **Correlation**: Shooting stats use Binomial(attempts, pct) to ensure consistency
  - Points calculated as: `PTS = 2*(FGM - 3PM) + 3*3PM + FTM`
  - Prevents impossible stat lines

### Model Fitting
```python
model = FantasyProjectionModel(evolution_rate=0.5)
model.fit_player(historical_data, 'Luka Doncic')

# Learns from historical games:
# - Shooting distributions (FG%, FT%, 3P%)
# - Attempt rates (FGA, FTA, 3PA per game)
# - Counting stats (PTS, REB, AST, STL, BLK, TO, DD)
# - Variance and uncertainty
```

### Evolution Rate
`evolution_rate=0.5` controls how quickly the model adapts:
- Higher = more weight on recent games (responsive to hot/cold streaks)
- Lower = more stable predictions (less variance)
- 0.5 is a balanced middle ground

---

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Simulate Current Week Matchups

Assuming you have fresh data in `box_scores_latest.csv`:

```bash
# Run simulation
python simulate_with_correct_data.py

# Check results
cat fixed_simulations/all_matchups_summary.csv

# Validate against actuals (after week completes)
python analyze_actual_vs_simulated.py
```

### 2. Debug Specific Matchup

```python
# Modify simulate_with_correct_data.py to filter:
matchups = ['BDE vs Burrito Barnes']  # Only simulate this one

# Run with verbose output
python simulate_with_correct_data.py

# Check detailed simulation results
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('fixed_simulations/BDE_vs_Burrito_Barnes/all_simulations.csv')
print(df[['team_a_cats', 'team_b_cats', 'winner']].describe())
```

### 3. Compare Player Contributions

```python
# Extract player-level stats from simulations
# This requires modifying simulate_with_correct_data.py to save player-level data
# Currently it only saves team aggregates
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Players Not Found in Models

**Symptom:**
```
WARNING: 3 players could not be mapped
         ['Derik Queen', 'Cooper Flagg', 'Tre Johnson']
```

**Cause:** New players not in historical data (rookies, late-season pickups)

**Solution:**
1. Check `player_mapping_latest.csv` for correct name mapping
2. Add ESPN projection fallback:
   ```python
   # In fit_player_models():
   for _, row in espn_proj.iterrows():
       if espn_name not in player_models:
           model.fit_from_espn_projection(row)
   ```
3. Or skip unmapped players (simulation continues with available players)

### Issue: Low Player Count

**Symptom:**
```
Team A: 2 players, 2 games  # Should be 12+ players, 25+ games
```

**Cause:** Wrong data source (old CSV file or wrong week filter)

**Solution:**
1. Verify using `box_scores_latest.csv`
2. Check week filter: `week6_data = box_scores[box_scores['week'] == 6]`
3. Validate box_scores has recent data:
   ```bash
   head -1 data/matchups/box_scores_latest.csv
   # Should show Week 6, October 2025 matchups
   ```

### Issue: All Predictions Wrong

**Symptom:**
```
Accuracy: 2/7 (28.6%)  # Should be >70%
```

**Cause:** Using wrong data (November 2024 instead of October 2025)

**Solution:**
1. DO NOT use `/Users/rhu/fantasybasketball2/data/daily_matchups/`
2. ALWAYS use `/Users/rhu/fantasybasketball2/fantasy_2026/data/matchups/box_scores_latest.csv`
3. See `SIMULATION_FIX_REPORT.md` for detailed explanation

---

## Data Update Workflow

When new game data arrives:

1. **Update box_scores_latest.csv**
   ```bash
   # Run data collection scripts in parent directory
   cd /Users/rhu/fantasybasketball2/fantasy_2026
   ./run_all.py  # This should update all _latest.csv files
   ```

2. **Verify data quality**
   ```bash
   python analyze_actual_vs_simulated.py
   # Check player counts, game counts match expectations
   ```

3. **Run simulations**
   ```bash
   python simulate_with_correct_data.py
   ```

4. **Archive results**
   ```bash
   # Rename fixed_simulations to week-specific name
   mv fixed_simulations week6_simulations_2025
   ```

---

## Integration with Other Systems

### From Parent Directory (fantasy_modeling/)

The `fantasy_modeling/` system provides more sophisticated Bayesian models but requires specific data formats. This `fantasy_2026/` system uses the simpler `weekly_projection_system.py` which has proven 100% accurate on Week 6.

**To integrate fantasy_modeling:**
1. Convert `historical_gamelogs_latest.csv` to fantasy_modeling format
2. Replace `FantasyProjectionModel` with `GameSimulator` from fantasy_modeling
3. Update column name mappings (PLAYER_NAME → player_name, etc.)

### From H-Scoring System

The `h_scoring/` directory contains draft optimization tools. To feed simulation results into h_scoring:

```python
# Load simulation results
import pandas as pd
summary = pd.read_csv('fixed_simulations/all_matchups_summary.csv')

# Extract team strength metrics
team_stats = summary.groupby('team_a_name').agg({
    'team_a_win_pct': 'mean',
    'team_a_avg_cats_won': 'mean'
}).rename(columns={
    'team_a_win_pct': 'win_rate',
    'team_a_avg_cats_won': 'avg_categories'
})

# Use in h_optimizer_final.py for draft valuation
```

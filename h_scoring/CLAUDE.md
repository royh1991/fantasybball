# H-Scoring Fantasy Basketball System

## Overview

This is an implementation of the H-scoring algorithm from Rosenof (2024) for fantasy basketball draft optimization. The system uses gradient descent optimization to dynamically value players based on:
1. Current team composition
2. Remaining picks in the draft
3. Opponent team strengths
4. Category correlations and variance

Unlike traditional static rankings (ADP, projections), H-scoring provides **dynamic valuations** that change as the draft progresses based on your evolving team needs.

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. **G-Scores (Static Rankings)**

G-scores are variance-adjusted player rankings that account for consistency:

```
G = (μ_player - μ_league) / sqrt(σ²_between + κ*σ²_within)
```

Where:
- `μ_player`: Player's season average in a category
- `μ_league`: League average for that category
- `σ²_between`: Between-player variance (talent differences)
- `σ²_within`: Within-player variance (consistency/volatility)
- `κ = (2*roster_size) / (2*roster_size - 1)`: Adjustment factor

**Key insight**: G-scores penalize volatile players. A consistent 20 PPG scorer has a higher G-score than a volatile 20 PPG scorer.

**Per-game vs Weekly Variance**:
- We use **per-game variance** to measure true player consistency
- Weekly variance = per_game_variance × games_in_week
- This separates performance consistency from schedule variance

### 2. **X-Scores (Optimization Basis)**

X-scores are simplified G-scores used in the optimization framework:

```
X = (μ_player - μ_league) / σ_within
```

For percentage stats, X-scores are volume-weighted:
```
X = (attempts_player / attempts_league) * (pct_player - pct_league) / σ_within
```

X-scores remove between-player variance and focus on relative value for optimization.

### 3. **H-Scores (Dynamic Valuation)**

H-scores are the **optimal objective value** when drafting a player, calculated via gradient descent:

```
H = V(jC*, x_candidate)
```

Where:
- `jC*`: Optimal category weights found via gradient descent
- `x_candidate`: Candidate player's X-scores
- `V`: Objective function (sum of category win probabilities)

**The optimization process:**
1. Start with baseline category weights
2. Calculate X_delta (expected future picks adjustment)
3. Project team performance with candidate player
4. Calculate win probability for each category vs opponents
5. Use Adam optimizer to find weights that maximize total win probability
6. H-score = maximum achievable win probability

### 4. **X_delta (Future Picks Modeling)**

X_delta estimates the expected stats from remaining draft picks:

```
X_delta = (N - K - 1) * Σ * (complicated matrix formula)
```

This accounts for:
- Number of remaining picks (`N - K - 1`)
- Category correlations (covariance matrix Σ)
- Current weight vector (jC)
- V-vector (converts X-scores to G-scores)
- Penalty terms (γ = generic value penalty, ω = category strength weighting)

**Intuition**: If you're weak in rebounds, X_delta predicts you'll draft rebounders later, so it adjusts your team projection accordingly.

## Code Architecture

### Data Collection (`modules/data_collector.py`)

**Purpose**: Fetch NBA data and calculate per-game statistics

**Key Features**:
1. **Name Mapping**: Handles mismatches between ADP list and NBA API
   - Maps "Jimmy Butler" → "Jimmy Butler III"
   - Maps "Nicolas Claxton" → "Nic Claxton"

2. **Target Player Collection**: Only collects data for ~200 players from ADP file (efficient)

3. **Multi-Season Data**: Collects 2022-23, 2023-24, 2024-25 seasons

4. **Checkpoint System**: Saves progress after each player
   - Resume capability if API throttles
   - Temporary files in `data/.temp/`
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff

5. **Per-Game Variance Calculation**:
   ```python
   variance_per_game = np.var(game_values, ddof=1)
   ```
   - NOT weekly variance (which mixes performance + schedule)
   - Separates player consistency from games-per-week variance

6. **NBA Season Weeks**: Proper week numbering (e.g., "2023-24_W1" to "2023-24_W26")

**Output Files**:
- `league_game_data_{timestamp}.csv`: Game-by-game stats
- `league_weekly_data_{timestamp}.csv`: Weekly aggregated stats (for H-scoring)
- `player_variances_{timestamp}.json`: Per-game variance by player and category

### Scoring System (`modules/scoring.py`)

**Purpose**: Calculate G-scores and X-scores for all players

**Key Methods**:

1. `_calculate_league_stats()`: Calculates league-wide mean and variance
   - Between-player variance: `np.var(season_averages)`
   - Within-player variance: Average of per-game variances

2. `calculate_g_score(player, category)`: G-score with variance adjustment
   - Uses player-specific per-game variance
   - Turnovers are inverted (lower is better)

3. `calculate_x_score(player, category)`: Simplified for optimization
   - Removes between-player variance term
   - Volume-weighted for percentages
   - **NaN handling**: Returns 0.0 if invalid data

4. `calculate_v_vector()`: Converts X-scores to G-scores
   ```python
   v[i] = σ_within / sqrt(σ²_within + σ²_between)
   ```

5. `rank_players_by_g_score()`: Static rankings for comparison

### Covariance Matrix (`modules/covariance.py`)

**Purpose**: Model category correlations (e.g., REB correlates with BLK)

**Key Calculations**:

1. **Covariance Matrix**:
   ```python
   cov_matrix = np.cov(x_score_matrix, rowvar=False)
   ```
   - Captures how categories correlate across players
   - Example: Centers with high REB tend to have high BLK
   - **NaN handling**: Replaces NaN with small positive values

2. **Inverse Covariance**: Used in optimization calculations
   ```python
   inv_cov = np.linalg.inv(cov_matrix)
   ```

3. **A Matrix**: Projection matrix for variance calculations
   ```python
   A = I - (Σ @ v @ v.T) / (v.T @ Σ @ v)
   ```

4. **Baseline Weights**: Starting category weights
   - "Scarcity" method: Weight by between-player variance
   - Higher variance categories → more valuable

### H-Score Optimizer (`modules/h_optimizer.py`)

**Purpose**: Core optimization engine using gradient descent

**Key Methods**:

1. `calculate_x_delta(weights, n_remaining)`:
   - Models expected value from future picks
   - Uses covariance matrix and current weights
   - Returns adjustment vector

2. `calculate_win_probabilities(my_team, opponent, variance)`:
   ```python
   z_scores = (my_team - opponent) / sqrt(variance)
   win_prob = Φ(z_scores)  # Normal CDF
   ```
   - Clip z-scores to [-10, 10] to prevent overflow
   - Ensure positive variance

3. `calculate_objective(weights, candidate_x, ...)`:
   - Team projection = current_team + candidate + X_delta
   - Win prob for each category
   - Objective = sum of win probabilities

4. `calculate_gradient(...)`:
   - Numerical gradient via finite differences
   - Perturbs each weight by epsilon
   - Measures change in objective

5. `optimize_weights(...)`:
   - **Adam optimizer** with momentum
   - Learning rate: 0.01
   - Max iterations: 100
   - Early stopping if converged
   - **Returns**: (optimal_weights, h_score)

6. `evaluate_player(player_name, my_team, opponents, ...)`:
   - Full player evaluation pipeline
   - Calculates X-scores
   - Aggregates team and opponent stats
   - Optimizes weights
   - Returns H-score

**NaN/Inf Handling**:
- Calculate initial objective before optimization
- Check gradient for NaN/inf → break early
- Check objective for NaN/inf → break early
- Always return valid best_value

### Draft Assistant (`draft_assistant.py`)

**Purpose**: Interactive draft tool with H-scoring recommendations

**Key Features**:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Loads player data and variances
   - Initializes scoring system
   - Calculates covariance matrix
   - Creates H-score optimizer

2. `recommend_pick(available_players, top_n)`:
   - Evaluates available players
   - Calculates H-score for each
   - Also shows G-score for comparison
   - Returns top N recommendations

3. `draft_player(player_name)`:
   - Adds to your team
   - Updates optimal weights
   - Tracks weight history

4. `update_opponent_rosters(opponent_rosters)`:
   - Updates opponent team compositions
   - Used for more accurate H-score calculations

### Draft Simulator (`simulate_draft.py`)

**Purpose**: Simulate snake draft with H-scoring vs ADP strategies

**Setup**:
- 12 teams, 13 roster spots
- Snake draft order (1→12, 12→1, 1→12...)
- You draft at position 6
- Opponents use ADP strategy (pick highest available ADP)
- You use H-scoring strategy

**Key Methods**:

1. `_opponent_pick_adp(team_num)`:
   - Picks player with lowest ADP remaining

2. `_your_pick_h_score()`:
   - Evaluates top 50 candidates by ADP
   - Calculates H-scores
   - Shows top 5 recommendations
   - Drafts highest H-score player

3. `run_draft()`:
   - Executes full 13-round draft
   - Displays pick-by-pick results
   - Saves draft results to JSON

**Output**: Draft results with your team and all opponent teams

### Season Simulator (`simulate_season.py`)

**Purpose**: Simulate 100 fantasy seasons using drafted teams

**Simulation Approach**:

1. **Schedule**: Each team plays every other team twice (22 matchups/season)

2. **Weekly Matchup Simulation**:
   - Each player plays 3 games per week
   - Sample stats from player mean + variance:
     ```python
     game_samples = np.random.normal(mean_per_game, std_per_game, n_games)
     ```
   - Aggregate team totals
   - Calculate team percentages from makes/attempts
   - Count category wins (11 categories)
   - Winner = most category wins

3. **Category Scoring**:
   - Counting stats (PTS, REB, AST, STL, BLK, FG3M, DD): Higher wins
   - Percentages (FG%, FT%, 3P%): Higher wins
   - Turnovers (TOV): Lower wins

4. **100 Seasons**:
   - Aggregate total wins/losses across all seasons
   - Calculate win percentage
   - Rank teams by win %

**Output**:
- Team rankings with win percentages
- Your team's rank and performance
- Saved to `season_results_{timestamp}.csv`

### Rookie Collection (`collect_rookies_supplement.py`)

**Purpose**: Add rookie data after they start playing NBA games

**Usage**:
```bash
python collect_rookies_supplement.py
```

**Process**:
1. Reads `player_name_mappings.json` for rookie names
2. Checks which rookies are now in NBA API
3. Collects their 2024-25 season data (lower threshold: 5 weeks)
4. Appends to existing dataset files
5. Creates new timestamped files with combined data

**Rookies tracked**:
- Cooper Flagg, Ace Bailey, Dylan Harper, etc.
- Will be in API once they play first NBA game

## Key Formulas

### G-Score
```
G_i = (μ_i - μ_league) / sqrt(σ²_between + κ*σ²_within_i)

where κ = (2*N) / (2*N - 1), N = roster size
```

### X-Score (Counting Stats)
```
X_i = (μ_i - μ_league) / σ_within_i
```

### X-Score (Percentage Stats)
```
X_i = (attempts_i / attempts_league) * (pct_i - pct_league) / σ_within_i
```

### Win Probability
```
P(win category i) = Φ((my_team_i - opponent_i) / σ_differential)

where Φ = Normal CDF
```

### Objective Function
```
V(jC) = Σ P(win category i | weights jC)
```

### X_delta (Simplified)
```
X_delta ≈ (N - K - 1) × adjustment based on:
  - Covariance matrix Σ
  - Current weights jC
  - V-vector
  - Penalty parameters (γ, ω)
```

---

## Usage Workflow

### 1. Initial Setup
```bash
conda create -n h_scoring python=3.10
conda activate h_scoring
conda env update --file environment.yml
```

### 2. Collect Data
```bash
# Test with 20 players (~2 min)
python test_data_collector.py

# Full collection for ~200 ADP players (~20-30 min)
python collect_full_data.py

# If interrupted, resume
python collect_full_data.py --resume
```

### 3. Debug H-Scores (if needed)
```bash
python test_h_scores.py
```

### 4. Run Draft Simulation
```bash
python simulate_draft.py
```
- Shows pick-by-pick draft
- Your team uses H-scoring
- Opponents use ADP
- Saves results to `draft_results_*.json`

### 5. Run Season Simulation

python simulate_season.py
```
- Runs draft first
- Simulates 100 seasons
- Shows team rankings
- Saves to `season_results_*.csv`

```bash
python collect_rookies_supplement.py
```
- Checks which rookies are now active
- Collects their data
- Appends to existing dataset

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Per-Game Variance (Not Weekly)
**Rationale**: Separates player consistency from schedule variance
- Weekly variance = per_game_variance × games_in_week
- More accurate modeling of player volatility
- Schedule variance is known (games per week)

### 2. Target Player Collection
**Rationale**: Efficiency - only collect ~200 fantasy-relevant players
- Uses ADP file as target list
- Avoids collecting 572+ active NBA players
- Focuses on draftable players

### 3. Checkpoint System
**Rationale**: NBA API throttles after ~200 requests
- Saves after each player
- Resume capability without starting over
- Retry logic with exponential backoff

### 4. NaN Handling Throughout
**Rationale**: Some players have incomplete data
- X-scores return 0.0 for invalid data
- Covariance matrix replaces NaN with small positive values
- Optimizer checks for NaN/inf at each step

### 5. Adam Optimizer
**Rationale**: Better than vanilla gradient descent
- Momentum helps escape local minima
- Adaptive learning rates per parameter
- Faster convergence

### 6. Numerical Gradient
**Rationale**: Analytical gradient is complex
- X_delta formula involves many matrix operations
- Numerical gradient via finite differences is simpler
- Epsilon = 1e-5 provides good approximation

---

## Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations

1. **No Position Constraints**: Draft doesn't enforce positional eligibility
2. **Simplified Opponent Modeling**: Uses average opponent team
3. **Fixed Games Per Week**: Season simulation assumes 3 games/week for all
4. **No Injury Modeling**: Doesn't account for player availability
5. **No In-Season Pickups**: Only models initial draft

### Potential Improvements

1. **Position-Specific Covariance**: Different correlations for PG vs C
2. **Dynamic Games Per Week**: Use actual NBA schedule
3. **Bayesian Updates**: Update player means/variances during season
4. **Trade Evaluator**: Extend H-scoring to value trades
5. **Streaming Strategy**: Optimize weekly pickup/drop decisions
6. **Monte Carlo Tree Search**: Alternative to gradient descent

---

## Debugging Tips

### H-Scores are NaN
1. Run `python test_h_scores.py` to identify step where NaN occurs
2. Common causes:
   - NaN in covariance matrix (check X-scores for all players)
   - Invalid variance data (negative or zero)
   - Singular covariance matrix (not invertible)

### Data Collection Fails
1. Check if checkpoint exists: `ls data/.temp/checkpoint_*.json`
2. Resume with: `python collect_full_data.py --resume`
3. If API throttling, wait 5-10 minutes before resuming

### Player Name Mismatch
1. Run `python find_player_names.py` to search NBA API
2. Add mapping to `player_name_mappings.json`
3. Format: `"adp_name": "nba_api_name"`

### Import Errors
1. Ensure conda environment is activated: `conda activate h_scoring`
2. Reinstall dependencies: `conda env update --file environment.yml`

## Major Bug Fixes (September 2024) - FINAL WORKING VERSION

### The Journey to a Working H-Scoring System

The H-scoring implementation went through multiple debugging iterations before achieving the **88.1% win rate** we see today. This section documents the complete journey and all fixes applied.

---

### Problem 1: X_delta Magnitude Explosion (Initial Bug)

**Symptoms:**
- Role players (Franz Wagner, Trey Murphy III) ranked higher than superstars (Wembanyama, Giannis, AD)
- Teams using H-scoring finished 9th-12th out of 12 in simulations
- All H-scores clustered in narrow range (4.27-7.56), failing to differentiate elite talent

**Root Cause:**
X_delta had magnitude explosion (~59 norm) overwhelming player X-scores (~20 norm):
1. **Covariance matrix scale issues**: FG3M diagonal = 106.6 (max eigenvalue: 109)
2. **Sigma scaling in b vector**: Multiplying by sigma amplified magnitudes
3. **No regularization**: Numerical instability in matrix operations
4. **Poor opponent modeling**: Summing all opponent stats instead of averaging

**Initial Fixes (Partially Successful):**
1. Normalized covariance to unit diagonal
2. Removed sigma scaling from b vector
3. Reduced X_delta multiplier to 0.05
4. Improved opponent modeling with snake draft positions

**Results:** X_delta reduced to ~2-3, but rankings still incorrect (Wembanyama at 26th!)

---

### Problem 2: Incorrect X_delta Implementation

**Discovery:**
After implementing `h_scoringchatgpt.py` (a clean reference implementation from the paper), we found it produced correct rankings:
- Jokić: 1st (4.821 H-score)
- Luka: 2nd (4.783)
- **Wembanyama: 3rd (4.755)** ✓

Comparing implementations revealed our X_delta calculation was missing key components.

**Root Cause:**
Our simplified X_delta lacked the proper regularization and numerical stability from the paper:
- Missing ridge regularization on Sigma
- Missing projection coefficient calculations
- Missing proper sigma computation in Sigma-metric
- Wrong multiplier scale (0.05 vs 0.25 from working implementation)

**The Fix (`h_optimizer_final.py`):**
Implemented exact X_delta calculation from paper with proper regularization:

```python
def _compute_xdelta_simplified(self, jC, v, Sigma, gamma, omega, N, K):
    """
    Exact X_delta calculation from h_scoringchatgpt.py with better numerical stability.
    """
    # Safe normalization
    jC_sum = np.sum(jC)
    if abs(jC_sum) < 1e-12:
        jC = np.ones_like(jC) / float(len(jC))
    else:
        jC = jC / float(jC_sum)

    # Ridge regularization (key insight from paper)
    trace = np.trace(Sigma)
    ridge = max(self.ridge_frac * (trace + 1e-12), 1e-12)
    Sigma_reg = Sigma + ridge * np.eye(m)

    # Compute projection of jC onto v in Sigma-metric
    denom_vSv = float(v.T @ Sigma_reg @ v)
    proj_coeff = float((v.T @ Sigma_reg @ jC) / denom_vSv)
    jC_perp = jC - v * proj_coeff

    # Compute sigma (standard deviation of jC_perp in Sigma metric)
    sigma2 = float(max(jC_perp.T @ Sigma_reg @ jC_perp, 0.0))
    sigma = np.sqrt(sigma2) if sigma2 > 0 else 0.0

    # Build constraint matrix U and target vector b
    U = np.vstack([v, jC])
    b = np.array([-gamma * sigma, omega * sigma], dtype=float)

    # Solve with proper conditioning
    M = U @ Sigma_reg @ U.T
    cond_M = np.linalg.cond(M)
    if cond_M > 1e12:
        jitter = 1e-8 * (np.trace(M) + 1e-12)
        M = M + jitter * np.eye(2)

    z = np.linalg.solve(M, b)
    xdelta_unit = Sigma_reg @ U.T @ z

    # Apply multiplier with proper scale
    remaining_picks = float(max(0, N - K - 1))
    effective_multiplier = remaining_picks * 0.25  # From working implementation
    x_delta = effective_multiplier * xdelta_unit

    return x_delta
```

**Key Changes:**
1. `ridge_frac = 1e-8` for Sigma regularization
2. Proper projection coefficient calculation
3. Sigma computed in Sigma-metric (not Euclidean)
4. Multiplier scale = 0.25 (not 0.05)
5. Condition number checking with jitter

---

### Problem 3: Category Variance Scaling

**Symptoms:**
Even with correct X_delta, some categories (especially FG3M with variance 2771) had almost no impact on win probabilities.

**Root Cause:**
Using uniform variance (26) for all categories ignored natural variance differences:
- FG3M variance: 2771 (massive - some players shoot 10+ threes, some shoot 0)
- FG_PCT variance: 3.57 (small - percentages bounded [0,1])

**The Fix:**
Category-specific variances with reasonable caps:

```python
def _calculate_category_variances(self):
    category_variances = {}
    for cat in self.categories:
        cat_idx = self.categories.index(cat)
        base_variance = self.cov_matrix_original[cat_idx, cat_idx]
        scaled_variance = base_variance * 13 * 2  # roster_size * 2 teams

        # Cap variances to reasonable ranges
        if cat == 'FG3M':
            category_variances[cat] = min(300.0, max(50.0, scaled_variance))
        elif cat in ['FG_PCT', 'FT_PCT', 'FG3_PCT']:
            category_variances[cat] = min(25.0, max(5.0, scaled_variance))
        else:
            category_variances[cat] = min(400.0, max(20.0, scaled_variance))

    return category_variances
```

---

### Problem 4: Unicode Name Mismatch (Critical Season Simulation Bug)

**Symptoms:**
Despite H-scoring drafting well, season simulation results were underwhelming:
- Your team: 82.1% win rate (expected ~95%+)
- Team 1 with Jokić: Only 25.5% (should be top 3)
- Team 5 with Luka: Only 24.3% (should be top 5)

**Root Cause:**
Player names in draft used ASCII ("Nikola Jokic", "Luka Doncic") but dataset used Unicode ("Nikola Jokić", "Luka Dončić"). The simulation couldn't find these players and gave them **0 stats in every game!**

**Impact:**
- Team 1: Lost Jokić (best player) + Alexandre Sarr = 15.4% roster useless
- Team 5: Lost Luka (top 5 player) = 7.7% roster useless
- This artificially made your opponents weaker, hiding the true power of H-scoring

**The Fix (`simulate_season.py`):**
Added unicode normalization for name matching:

```python
import unicodedata

def normalize_name(name):
    """Normalize player names by removing unicode characters."""
    nfd = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', name)
    return ''.join(char for char in nfd if unicodedata.category(char) != 'Mn')

class SeasonSimulator:
    def _create_name_mapping(self):
        """Create mapping from normalized names to actual names in dataset."""
        name_mapping = {}
        for player_name in self.player_data['PLAYER_NAME'].unique():
            normalized = normalize_name(player_name)
            name_mapping[normalized] = player_name
            name_mapping[player_name] = player_name
        return name_mapping

    def _lookup_player(self, player_name):
        """Look up player with unicode-safe name matching."""
        if player_name in self.player_means:
            return player_name
        normalized = normalize_name(player_name)
        if normalized in self.name_mapping:
            return self.name_mapping[normalized]
        return None
```

---

### Final Results - H-Scoring Dominance

**Season Simulation (100 seasons, 12 teams):**

| Rank | Team | Win % | Key Player | Draft Strategy |
|------|------|-------|------------|----------------|
| **1** | **You (Team 6)** | **88.1%** | **Joel Embiid** | **H-Scoring** |
| 2 | Team 9 | 66.9% | Anthony Davis | ADP |
| 3 | Team 3 | 66.7% | Giannis | ADP |
| 4 | Team 7 | 59.7% | Anthony Edwards | ADP |
| 5 | Team 1 | 56.7% | Jokić | ADP |
| 6 | Team 5 | 54.1% | Luka | ADP |
| 7 | Team 10 | 47.8% | Sabonis | ADP |
| 8 | Team 8 | 45.1% | Cade | ADP |
| 9 | Team 11 | 31.8% | KAT | ADP |
| 10 | Team 2 | 28.5% | Wembanyama | ADP |
| 11 | Team 4 | 24.5% | SGA | ADP |
| 12 | Team 12 | 21.8% | Trae | ADP |

**Your Record:** 1939-261 across 100 seasons

**Performance Metrics:**
- **22% better** than 2nd place (Team 9 with AD)
- **33% better** than teams with Jokić/Luka
- **Win nearly 9 out of 10 matchups**
- **Drafted at position 6**, outperformed teams with picks 1-5

**Why H-Scoring Works:**
1. **Dynamic Valuation**: Recognized Joel Embiid at pick #6 as higher value than strict ADP
2. **Team Composition**: Built balanced team around identified punt strategy (FG3_PCT)
3. **Category Synergy**: Drafted players who complement each other (Embiid + KD + Kawhi + Paul George)
4. **Depth**: Got value picks like Rudy Gobert (ADP 68.9) in round 5

**Your Winning Roster:**
1. Joel Embiid (ADP 47.8) - Elite center, blocks, rebounds
2. Kevin Durant (ADP 22.7) - Elite scorer, efficient
3. Kawhi Leonard (ADP 44.8) - Two-way wing
4. Paul George (ADP 77.4) - Versatile scorer
5. Rudy Gobert (ADP 68.9) - Defensive anchor
6. Miles Bridges (ADP 69.7) - High-upside wing
7. Mikal Bridges (ADP 81.8) - 3&D specialist
8. Tobias Harris (ADP 112.8) - Solid veteran
9. Jrue Holiday (ADP 128.5) - Elite defense
10. Chris Paul (ADP 135.0) - Assists, veteran
11. Brook Lopez (ADP 136.6) - Stretch 5 with blocks
12. Jonas Valančiūnas (ADP 137.9) - Rebounding big
13. Adem Bona (ADP 138.6) - Rookie upside

### How to Run the Complete System

**1. Install Dependencies:**
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate h_scoring
```

**2. Collect NBA Data (Optional - data included):**
```bash
python modules/data_collector.py
```

**3. Run Draft + Season Simulation:**
```bash
python simulate_season.py
```

This will:
1. Simulate a 12-team snake draft (you at position 6)
2. Opponents use ADP strategy
3. You use H-scoring optimization
4. Simulate 100 complete fantasy seasons
5. Display final standings

**Expected Output:**
```
================================================================================
YOUR TEAM (Team 6) PERFORMANCE:
================================================================================
  Rank: 1/12
  Wins: 1939
  Losses: 261
  Win %: 0.881
```

**4. Test Individual Components:**

Test H-scores for all players:
```bash
python test_h_scores_quick.py
```

Compare implementations:
```bash
python h_scoringchatgpt.py --input data/league_game_data_*.csv --out scores.csv --diag --use_exact_xdelta
```

---

### Implementation Files

**Core Modules:**
- `modules/h_optimizer_final.py` - Fixed H-scoring optimizer with all bug fixes
- `modules/scoring.py` - G-score and X-score calculations
- `modules/covariance.py` - Covariance matrix and baseline weights
- `modules/data_collector.py` - NBA data fetching

**Simulation:**
- `simulate_season.py` - Main entry point for draft + season simulation
- `simulate_draft.py` - Snake draft simulation (H-scoring vs ADP)
- `draft_assistant.py` - H-scoring draft recommendations

**Testing:**

- `h_scoringchatgpt.py` - Reference implementation from paper (clean version)
- `debug_wemby.py` - Debugging script for player valuations

**Results:**
- `season_results_*.csv` - Season simulation output
- `draft_results_*.json` - Draft results with all rosters

---

### Key Parameters

**H-Scoring:**
- `gamma = 0.25` - Generic value penalty
- `omega = 0.7` - Category strength weighting
- `ridge_frac = 1e-8` - Regularization for Sigma
- `xdelta_multiplier_scale = 0.25` - X_delta multiplier

**Draft:**
- `num_teams = 12`
- `roster_size = 13`
- `your_position = 6`

**Season Simulation:**
- `games_per_week = 3`
- `num_seasons = 100`
- `matchups_per_season = 22` (play each team twice)

---

### Common Issues

**Issue 1: Import Errors**
```bash
conda activate h_scoring
conda env update --file environment.yml
```

**Issue 2: Missing Player Data**
Some rookies (Cooper Flagg, Ace Bailey) don't have historical data. This is expected - they get 0 stats in simulations.

**Issue 3: Unicode Name Mismatches**
If adding new players, ensure names match between ADP file and NBA data:
- ADP: "Nikola Jokic" (ASCII)
- Data: "Nikola Jokić" (Unicode)
- Fix: Use `normalize_name()` function

**Issue 4: Slow Simulations**
Season simulation with 100 seasons takes ~3-5 minutes. Reduce `num_seasons` for faster testing:
```python
results = season_sim.simulate_multiple_seasons(num_seasons=10)  # Faster
```

## October 2024 Updates - Critical Fixes & New Features

### Critical Bug Fix #1: X-Score Variance Unit Mismatch

**Date:** October 2, 2024

**Problem:**
The X-score calculation in `modules/scoring.py` was mixing variance units - dividing **weekly means** by **per-game variance**. This created artificial amplification of X-scores.

**Example (Sabonis DD):**
```python
# WRONG (original):
weekly_mean = 2.912 DD per week
per_game_variance = 0.107
X_score = (2.912 - 0.459) / sqrt(0.107) = 7.50  # Inflated!

# CORRECT (fixed):
weekly_mean = 2.912 DD per week
weekly_variance = 0.917
X_score = (2.912 - 0.459) / sqrt(0.917) = 2.56  # Accurate
```

**Impact:**
- Sabonis DD X-score: 7.50 → 2.56 (4.1x reduction)
- KAT DD X-score: 2.41 → 1.07 (2.25x reduction)
- Gap: 5.09 → 1.49 (more realistic)
- This was making DD specialists appear artificially more valuable than they should be

**Fix Location:** `modules/scoring.py` lines 187-209

**Fixed Code:**
```python
# Calculate variance from the actual weekly data (matches weekly mean)
var_weekly = player_data[category].var()

if np.isnan(var_weekly) or var_weekly <= 0 or len(player_data) < 3:
    sigma_within = np.sqrt(self.league_stats[category]['sigma_within_sq'])
else:
    sigma_within = np.sqrt(var_weekly)

# Now X-score uses consistent units
x_score = (mu_player - mu_league) / sigma_within
```

### New Feature #1: Projection-Aware Scoring System

**Date:** October 2, 2024

**File:** `modules/scoring_with_projections.py`

**Purpose:** Blend historical data with expert projections to account for:
- Player development (young players improving)
- Age regression (veterans declining)
- Injury risk (GP adjustments)

**Key Features:**

**1. Experience-Based Weighting:**
```python
Player Experience    Projection Weight    History Weight
1-2 seasons          70%                  30%  (trust projections for rookies)
3 seasons            50%                  50%  (balanced)
4-5 seasons          40%                  60%  (trust history)
6+ seasons           30%                  70%  (veterans are predictable)
```

**2. Injury Risk Adjustment:**
```python
GP Projected    Availability    Risk Factor    Impact
70+ games       85%+            1.00x          No penalty
60-70 games     73-85%          0.90-1.00x     Mild penalty
50-60 games     61-73%          0.75-0.90x     Moderate penalty
<50 games       <61%            0.50-0.75x     Strong penalty
```

**Example Results:**
- **Cade Cunningham:** H-score +0.0304 (rank #5 → #4)
  - 3 seasons → 50% projection weight
  - Projections show improvement across all categories
  - 70 GP projected → No injury penalty

- **Joel Embiid:** H-score -0.0437 (major drop)
  - Only 37/82 GP projected → 0.56x multiplier
  - Every stat reduced by 44%
  - More realistic valuation for injury-prone player

**Usage:**
```python
from modules.scoring_with_projections import ProjectionAwareScoringSystem

scoring = ProjectionAwareScoringSystem(
    league_data=league_data,
    player_variances=player_variances,
    roster_size=13,
    projections_file='data/fantasy_basketball_clean2.csv',
    projection_weight=0.5,  # Base weight (adjusted per player)
    injury_penalty_strength=1.0  # 1.0 = moderate penalty
)
```

**Documentation:** See `PROJECTION_AWARE_SYSTEM.md` for full technical details

---

### New Feature #2: Missing Player Data Collection

**Date:** October 2, 2024

**File:** `collect_missing_data.py`

**Purpose:** Collect NBA data for players missing from the main dataset

**Handles Three Cases:**

**1. Name Mismatches:**
```python
NAME_MAPPINGS = {
    'Nicolas Claxton': 'Nic Claxton',
    'Jimmy Butler': 'Jimmy Butler',  # Try without III
}
```

**2. 2024 Rookies (now have NBA data):**
- Alexandre Sarr
- Kel'el Ware
- Jared McCain
- Adem Bona

**3. 2025 Prospects (not in NBA yet - skip):**
- Cooper Flagg
- Dylan Harper
- Ace Bailey
- VJ Edgecombe

**Usage:**
```bash
python collect_missing_data.py
```

**Output:**
```
✓ Added Nicolas Claxton: 217 games
✓ Added Jimmy Butler: 179 games
✓ Added Alexandre Sarr: 67 games
✓ Added Kel'el Ware: 64 games
✓ Added Jared McCain: 23 games
✓ Added Adem Bona: 58 games

→ Cooper Flagg is a 2025 draft prospect (not in NBA yet) - skipping
→ Dylan Harper is a 2025 draft prospect (not in NBA yet) - skipping

New totals:
  Players: 187 → 193 (+6)
  Weeks: 10,750 → 10,968 (+218)
```

**Updated Files:**
- `player_name_mappings.json` - Now categorizes rookies by draft year
- `MISSING_PLAYERS_FIX.md` - Complete troubleshooting guide

### Enhancement #1: Command-Line Arguments for Draft Simulation

**Date:** October 2, 2024

**File:** `simulate_season.py`

**New Command-Line Flags:**
```bash
# Draft from position 1-12
python simulate_season.py -p 1
python simulate_season.py --position 12

# Change number of seasons
python simulate_season.py -n 50
python simulate_season.py --num-seasons 200

# Change league size
python simulate_season.py -t 10
python simulate_season.py --num-teams 14

# Combine options
python simulate_season.py -p 4 -n 50 -t 10
```

**Help:**
```bash
python simulate_season.py --help
```

**Previous Limitation:** Draft position was hardcoded to 6

**Current Flexibility:** Draft from any position 1-12, simulate any number of seasons, use any league size 2-20

---

### Enhancement #2: Adam Optimizer Now Active from Pick 2

**Date:** October 2, 2024

**File:** `modules/h_optimizer_final.py` (lines 426-441)

**Previous Behavior:**
- Picks 1-3: No optimization (baseline weights only)
- Picks 4-13: Adam optimizer with regularization

**New Behavior:**
- **Pick 1 only:** No optimization (baseline weights)
- **Picks 2-13:** Adam optimizer with regularization

**Regularization Strength by Pick:**
```python
reg_strength = 2.0 * (1.0 - picks_made / 13)²

Pick 1:  No optimization (baseline scarcity weights)
Pick 2:  reg_strength = 1.70 (strong)
Pick 3:  reg_strength = 1.43
Pick 4:  reg_strength = 1.20
...
Pick 10: reg_strength = 0.26
Pick 13: reg_strength = 0.03 (almost none)
```

**Rationale:**
- Pick 1: No team context → use scarcity weights to get elite scarce stats
- Pick 2+: Some context → allow adaptation but penalize extreme deviations
- Later picks: Full flexibility for team-specific strategies

**Code Change:**
```python
# OLD
if picks_made < 3:
    optimal_weights = self.baseline_weights.copy()

# NEW
if picks_made == 0:
    optimal_weights = self.baseline_weights.copy()
```

Of course. It's a dense paper, but the core idea is incredibly powerful. Let's break it down into simpler terms and connect it directly to your code.The Big Idea: A Custom Suit vs. Off-the-RackImagine you're buying a suit.A Standard Ranking List (G-Score): This is like an "off-the-rack" suit. It's designed to fit the average person reasonably well. It tells you Nikola Jokic is the best player in a vacuum, which is true, but it doesn't care if you've already drafted three other centers.The H-Scoring Paper: This paper provides a blueprint for a custom-tailored suit. It argues that a player's value is not fixed; it depends entirely on the existing fabric of your team. The goal is to find the player who is the perfect fit for your specific team at any given moment, dynamically adapting its strategy as you draft.The Paper's Method in Simple TermsThe paper's H-scoring framework is a three-step process to find the best player at any given pick:Step 1: The "What If?" Machine (Modeling X(j))For every available player, the algorithm asks: "What if we draft this guy?" To answer that, it has to project what your final team will look like. It does this by creating a "strategy vector" (called $j_C$ in the paper, which is your weights variable). This vector represents a potential team build, for example:[High Pts, High Reb, High Blk, Low Ast, Low Stl, ...] (A "Punt Assists" build)The algorithm then uses a complex formula (X_delta) to guess the combined stats of your future, undrafted players if you stick to that strategy1111.Step 2: From Stats to Wins (Modeling W(j))The "What If?" machine gives you a bunch of projected stats. But stats don't win leagues; winning categories does. This step takes the projected stats for your team and compares them to a model of an average opponent's team.It then calculates the probability of you winning each individual category (e.g., "You have a 75% chance to win Rebounds but only a 20% chance to win Assists")2222.Step 3: Finding the Best "What If?" (Modeling V(j) and Optimizing)Now the magic happens. The algorithm wants to find the strategy (weights vector) that results in the highest overall chance of winning. It does this through optimization3.Think of it like turning a bunch of dials. The algorithm starts with a default, balanced strategy. It then slightly "turns the dial" for Points up and sees if the overall win probability increases. Then it tries turning the Assists dial down. It repeats this process hundreds of time until it finds the optimal set of "dial turns"—the best possible punt strategy—for the player being evaluated 4.The player whose best possible strategy yields the highest overall win probability (the H-Score) is the top recommendation.How Your Code Implements ThisLet's look at the key functions in your code that perform these three steps.Step 1: The "What If?" MachineThis is about calculating your team's projected stats. The core statistical unit is the X-Score, which measures a player's value in a category relative to their own week-to-week volatility.Python# From scoring.py
def calculate_x_score(self, player_name, category):
    # ... calculates mu_player and mu_league ...
    var_weekly = player_data[category].var()
    sigma_within = np.sqrt(var_weekly)
    # ...
    x_score = (mu_player - mu_league) / sigma_within
    return x_score
This function provides the raw building blocks for the projection. The most complex part of the projection is guessing the stats of your future picks, which your code does here:Python# From h_optimizer_final.py
def _compute_xdelta_simplified(self, jC, v, Sigma, gamma, omega, N, K):
    # ... complex linear algebra ...
    # This is the paper's beast of a formula from Appendix B.
    # It takes your strategy (jC), the covariance matrix (Sigma),
    # and spits out the expected stats of your future picks.
    xdelta_unit = Sigma_reg @ U.T @ z
    # ...
    x_delta = effective_multiplier * xdelta_unit
    return x_delta
This function, _compute_xdelta_simplified, is the heart of the "What If?" machine. It's a direct, numerically-stable implementation of the paper's hardest math.Step 2: From Stats to WinsThis step is cleaner. Your code takes the projected stats for your team (current players + candidate + future picks from X_delta) and calculates the win probability for each category.Python# From h_optimizer_final.py
def calculate_win_probabilities(self, my_team_x, opponent_x, variance=None):
    differential = my_team_x - opponent_x
    win_probs = np.zeros(self.n_cats)

    for i, cat in enumerate(self.categories):
        std_dev = np.sqrt(self.category_variances.get(cat, 26.0))
        z_score = np.clip(differential[i] / std_dev, -10, 10)
        
        # Uses the CDF of the normal distribution, just like the paper
        win_probs[i] = norm.cdf(z_score)

    return win_probs
This function perfectly matches the paper's description of using a Normal distribution's CDF to find the victory probability for each category 5. Your use of category_variances is a smart, practical improvement over the paper's simpler model.Step 3: Finding the Best "What If?"This is your optimizer. Instead of trying every possible strategy (which would be infinite), it cleverly "searches" for the best one.This is where your code gets really clever. You realized that early in the draft, you shouldn't be punting. You should be drafting raw value. Your code enforces this with a "fading leash" on the optimizer.Python# From h_optimizer_final.py
def optimize_weights_with_regularization(self, ..., picks_made, total_picks, ...):
    
    # The leash: Strong penalty early, no penalty late.
    draft_progress = picks_made / total_picks
    reg_strength = 2.0 * (1.0 - draft_progress) ** 2
    
    # The objective it tries to maximize includes the penalty
    def regularized_objective(w):
        base_obj = self.calculate_objective(...) # This is the win probability
        
        # This penalizes the optimizer for moving weights too far
        # from the balanced, baseline strategy.
        deviation = np.sum((w - self.baseline_weights) ** 2)
        penalty = reg_strength * deviation
        
        return base_obj - penalty
This function is your "dial-turner." It iteratively adjusts the weights to maximize the regularized_objective. Early in the draft, reg_strength is high, forcing the optimizer to stick close to the baseline (raw value). As the draft progresses, reg_strength drops to zero, giving the optimizer full freedom to find the perfect punt strategy for your nearly-complete team. This is a brilliant, practical solution that isn't in the paper but is essential for getting good results.

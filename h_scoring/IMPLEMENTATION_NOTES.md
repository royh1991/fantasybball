## Core Components

### 1. Data Collection (data_collector.py)

**Key Features:**
- Fetches game logs from `nba_api` for active players
- Aggregates game logs to weekly statistics (matches H2H format)
- Calculates player-specific variance for each category
- Handles 11 categories: PTS, REB, AST, STL, BLK, TOV, 3PM, FG%, FT%, 3P%, DD

**Main Classes:**
- `NBADataCollector`: Collects and processes NBA data

**Key Methods:**
- `fetch_player_gamelogs()`: Get game logs for a player/season
- `aggregate_to_weekly()`: Convert games to weekly stats
- `calculate_player_variance()`: Player-specific week-to-week variance
- `collect_league_data()`: Full league data collection pipeline

### 2. Scoring System (scoring.py)

**Key Features:**
- Implements G-scores (static rankings with variance adjustment)
- Implements X-scores (dynamic scoring for optimization)
- Uses player-specific variance (consistent players valued higher)
- Calculates v-vector for X-to-G conversion

**Main Classes:**
- `PlayerScoring`: Calculate G-scores and X-scores

**Key Methods:**
- `calculate_g_score()`: G-score for a player/category
  - Formula: `G = (μ_player - μ_league) / sqrt(σ²_between + κ*σ²_within)`
  - Where κ = 2N/(2N-1) for roster size N
- `calculate_x_score()`: X-score (removes between-player variance)
  - Formula: `X = (μ_player - μ_league) / σ_within`
- `calculate_v_vector()`: Conversion vector from X to G basis
- `rank_players_by_g_score()`: Static player rankings

### 3. Covariance Matrix (covariance.py)

**Key Features:**
- Calculates covariance matrix between categories
- Captures correlations (e.g., REB-BLK positive, 3PM-FG% negative)
- Calculates baseline weights using scarcity (coefficient of variation)
- Computes inverse covariance (precision matrix)

**Main Classes:**
- `CovarianceCalculator`: Covariance and baseline weight calculations

**Key Methods:**
- `calculate_covariance_matrix()`: Category correlation matrix
- `calculate_baseline_weights()`: Starting weights (scarcity-based)
- `calculate_inverse_covariance()`: For X_delta calculation
- `get_category_correlations()`: Analyze pairwise correlations
- `get_setup_params()`: All parameters needed for H-scoring

### 4. H-Score Optimizer (h_optimizer.py)

**Key Features:**
- Implements full H-scoring algorithm with gradient descent
- Calculates X_delta (future pick adjustment) using covariance
- Optimizes category weights to maximize win probability
- Uses Adam optimizer for stable convergence

**Main Classes:**
- `HScoreOptimizer`: Core H-scoring optimization

**Key Methods:**
- `calculate_x_delta()`: Expected future picks adjustment
  - Captures correlations via covariance matrix
  - Models how your weights affect future draft picks
- `calculate_win_probabilities()`: P(win each category)
  - Uses normal CDF: `Φ((team - opponent) / σ)`
- `calculate_objective()`: Total win probability
  - Each Category format: sum of category win probabilities
- `calculate_gradient()`: Gradient for weight optimization
  - Uses finite differences (analytical gradient possible but complex)
- `optimize_weights()`: Gradient descent with Adam
  - Iteratively improves weights to maximize objective
- `evaluate_player()`: Calculate H-score for a candidate player

**Algorithm Flow:**
```python
for each candidate_player:
    initialize weights (perturb baseline toward player)

    for iteration in range(max_iterations):
        # Calculate future adjustment
        x_delta = f(weights, covariance, n_remaining)

        # Project team totals
        team_total = current_team + candidate + x_delta

        # Calculate win probabilities
        win_prob = Φ((team_total - opponent) / σ)

        # Compute gradient
        gradient = ∂(sum(win_prob)) / ∂weights

        # Adam update
        weights += learning_rate * gradient

        # Normalize weights
        weights /= sum(weights)

    player_h_score = max(sum(win_prob))
```

### 5. Draft Assistant (draft_assistant.py)

**Key Features:**
- Interactive command-line draft tool
- Tracks your team and opponent rosters
- Discovers punt strategies automatically
- Exports draft results

**Main Classes:**
- `DraftAssistant`: Main user interface

**Key Methods:**
- `collect_data()`: One-time data collection
- `recommend_pick()`: Get top H-score recommendations
- `draft_player()`: Draft a player and update state
- `update_opponent_rosters()`: Track opponent picks
- `show_team_summary()`: Display current team

**Interactive Commands:**
- `rec` - Get H-score recommendations
- `draft <player>` - Draft a player
- `team` - Show current team
- `quit` - Exit

## Mathematical Implementation Details

### G-Score Formula
```
G = (μ_player - μ_league) / sqrt(σ²_between + κ*σ²_within)

Where:
- μ_player: Player's season average
- μ_league: League average
- σ²_between: Variance between players (league-wide)
- σ²_within: Player's week-to-week variance (consistency)
- κ = 2N/(2N-1) ≈ 1.04 for N=13
```

### X-Score Formula
```
X = (μ_player - μ_league) / σ_within

Same as G-score but removes between-player variance.
Used as the basis for optimization.
```

### X_delta Calculation (Simplified)
```
X_delta = n_remaining * Σ * direction * adjustment / denominator

Where:
- Σ: Covariance matrix (captures correlations)
- direction: (-γ)*weights - ω*v_vector
- adjustment: weights - v*(v^T*Σ*weights)/(v^T*Σ*v)
- denominator: weights^T*Σ*weights * v^T*Σ*v - (v^T*Σ*weights)²
```

This automatically models: "If I weight REB highly, I'll get more BLK (correlated) in future picks."

### Win Probability
```
P(win category) = Φ(z)

Where:
- z = (team_total - opponent_total) / sqrt(variance)
- Φ = Normal CDF
- variance = 2*N (both teams) + opponent_uncertainty
```

### Gradient Descent
```
weights[t+1] = weights[t] + learning_rate * gradient

Using Adam optimizer:
- m = β₁*m + (1-β₁)*gradient
- v = β₂*v + (1-β₂)*gradient²
- weights += lr * m / sqrt(v)
```

## Key Parameters

**Optimizer Parameters:**
- `omega = 0.7`: Weighted category strength multiplier
- `gamma = 0.25`: Generic value penalty
- `learning_rate = 0.01`: Gradient descent step size
- `max_iterations = 100`: Max optimization iterations
- `beta1 = 0.9`, `beta2 = 0.999`: Adam parameters

**Data Parameters:**
- `roster_size = 13`: League roster size
- `min_weeks = 20`: Minimum weeks for variance calculation
- `max_players = 200`: Top N players to collect

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from draft_assistant import DraftAssistant

# Initialize
assistant = DraftAssistant()

# Collect data (first time only)
assistant.collect_data(seasons=['2023-24'], max_players=150)

# Get recommendations
recommendations = assistant.recommend_pick(top_n=10)

# Draft a player
assistant.draft_player('Nikola Jokic')

# Continue drafting...
```

### Programmatic Usage
```python
# Load existing data
assistant = DraftAssistant(
    data_file='data/league_weekly_data.csv',
    variance_file='data/player_variances.json'
)

# Get player rankings
g_rankings = assistant.get_player_rankings('g_score', top_n=50)
h_rankings = assistant.get_player_rankings('h_score', top_n=50)

# Compare strategies
assistant.draft_player('Stephen Curry')
assistant.draft_player('Damian Lillard')
# H-scoring will now recommend bigs to complement guards

# Export results
assistant.export_results('my_draft.json')
```

## Algorithm Advantages

1. **Dynamic Adaptation**: Weights change based on team composition
2. **Automatic Punt Discovery**: No need to pre-decide strategy
3. **Correlation Awareness**: Knows AST-TOV correlated, etc.
4. **Consistency Valued**: Low variance players valued higher
5. **Mathematically Optimal**: Maximizes expected win probability

## Performance

- Data collection: 5-10 minutes for 150 players
- Covariance setup: ~10 seconds
- H-score per player: 0.1-0.5 seconds
- Full recommendations (100 players): 30-60 seconds

## Limitations & Future Work

**Current Limitations:**
1. Simplified variance model (constant per player)
2. Numerical gradient (could derive analytical)
3. Most Categories format simplified (not full tree calculation)
4. No position eligibility constraints
5. No injury/rest modeling

**Possible Enhancements:**
1. Position-specific covariance matrices
2. Analytical gradient derivation
3. Full tree-based Most Categories calculation
4. Trade value calculations
5. In-season player valuation
6. Bayesian uncertainty in variance estimates
7. Rest-of-season projections (not just historical)

## Testing & Validation

To validate implementation:
1. Compare G-score rankings to known rankings (Yahoo, ESPN)
2. Verify covariance matrix shows expected correlations
3. Check that punt strategies emerge naturally
4. Compare H-score vs G-score in mock drafts
5. Verify gradient descent converges

## Notes

This implementation prioritizes clarity and correctness over speed. Several optimizations are possible:
- Vectorize gradient calculations
- Cache covariance operations
- Parallelize player evaluations
- Use analytical gradients
- Reduce numerical precision where appropriate

# H-Scoring Implementation Guide for 11-Category Fantasy Basketball

## Executive Summary

H-scoring (Rosenof, 2024) is a dynamic player valuation system that recalculates player values during the draft based on your current team composition. It achieves 2.6-4.5x better performance than static rankings by using gradient descent optimization to adapt category weights in real-time.

## Core Mathematical Framework

### 1. G-Score Foundation

G-scores improve upon Z-scores by incorporating week-to-week variance, critical for H2H leagues:

```
G_score = (μ_player - μ_league) / sqrt(σ²_between + κ × σ²_within)

Where:
- μ_player = player's average in category
- μ_league = league average
- σ²_between = variance between players
- σ²_within = week-to-week variance for each player
- κ = 2N/(2N-1) ≈ 1.04 for N=13 roster size
```

**Key insight**: Categories with high week-to-week variance (like steals) are less valuable than Z-scores suggest.

### 2. Win Probability Model

For each category, model the differential between teams as normal distribution:

```
Differential ~ N(μ_diff, σ²_diff)

Where:
μ_diff = Your_Team_Score - Opponent_Score + Future_Pick_Adjustment
σ²_diff = combined variance

Win_Probability = Φ(μ_diff / σ_diff)  # Normal CDF
```

### 3. The Covariance Matrix Magic

The key innovation is modeling how your category weights affect future picks:

```
Δ_w = n_remaining × β × Σ^(-1) × (w - α)

Where:
- n_remaining = picks you have left
- β ≈ 1.0 (calibration parameter)
- Σ = covariance matrix of player stats
- Σ^(-1) = inverse covariance matrix
- w = your optimized weights
- α = baseline weights
```

**This automatically captures correlations**: If you weight REB highly, the formula knows you'll naturally get more BLK (positive correlation) and fewer AST (negative correlation) in future picks.

### 4. Gradient-Based Optimization

For each candidate player, optimize weights to maximize win probability:

```python
for each candidate_player:
    initialize weights w
    while not converged:
        # Calculate expected future picks based on weights
        future_adjustment = n_remaining × β × Σ^(-1) × (w - α)
        
        # Calculate win probability for each category
        for each category:
            team_total = current_team + candidate + future_adjustment
            win_prob[category] = Φ((team_total - opponent) / σ)
        
        # Calculate gradient and update weights
        gradient = ∂(sum(win_prob)) / ∂w
        w = w + learning_rate × gradient
        
    player_value = max(sum(win_prob))
```

## Implementation Pseudocode

### Step 1: Pre-Draft Setup

    player_stats = [[p[cat] for cat in categories] for p in top_200_players]
    Σ = covariance_matrix(player_stats)
    Σ_inv = inverse(Σ)

### Step 3: Punt Strategy Discovery

```python

    ]

### Step 5: Practical Optimizations

        ('REB', 'BLK'): 0.46,  # Moderate - big man stats
        ('3PM', 'FG%'): -0.48, # Negative - three pointers hurt FG%
        ('REB', 'DD'): 0.85,   # Very strong - rebounds drive double-doubles
        ('AST', 'FG%'): -0.23, # Weak negative - guards shoot worse

    # 3P% creates dependency with 3PM
    # Treat them as 1.5 categories each rather than 2 independent
    
    adjustments = {
        'DD_weight_multiplier': 1.15,  # DD favors consistent big men
        '3PM_3P%_combined_weight': 0.136  # Instead of 0.182 if independent
    }
    
    return adjustments
```

## Key Implementation Notes

### What Makes H-Scoring Work

1. **Dynamic adaptation**: Weights change based on your team composition
2. **Correlation awareness**: The covariance matrix captures player archetypes
3. **No hard-coded strategies**: Punting emerges naturally from optimization
4. **Week-to-week variance**: G-scores account for consistency, not just averages

### Critical Parameters to Tune

```python
tuning_parameters = {
    'β': 1.0,  # How much future picks affect current decision (0.8-1.2 range)
    'learning_rate': 0.01,  # Gradient descent step size (0.005-0.02 range)
    'convergence_threshold': 0.0001,  # When to stop optimizing
    'weight_floor': 0.001,  # Minimum category weight (prevent total abandonment)
}
```

### Punting Emerges Naturally

You don't need to decide "I'm punting FT%" beforehand. The algorithm discovers it:

1. You draft a player weak in FT% but strong elsewhere
2. The optimizer reduces FT% weight to maximize total win probability
3. Future picks bias toward players with similar profiles (via covariance matrix)
4. By round 4-5, you've naturally built a punt-FT% team

### Computational Efficiency

```python
# For 11 categories, pre-compute and cache:
cache = {
    'covariance_inverse': np.linalg.inv(Σ),  # Expensive, do once
    'player_g_scores': {},  # Calculate once per player
    'correlation_pairs': {},  # Store (category_i, category_j) correlations
}

# During draft, only optimize for top candidates:
def quick_filter(available_players, my_team):
    # Only run full H-scoring on top 20 players by ADP
    # This reduces computation 10x with minimal accuracy loss
    top_candidates = sorted(available_players, key=lambda p: p.adp)[:20]
    return top_candidates
```

## Summary

H-scoring revolutionizes fantasy drafts by treating player value as dynamic rather than static. The covariance matrix automatically encodes player archetypes (guards vs bigs), and gradient descent discovers optimal strategies (including punting) without explicit programming. For your 11-category league, the addition of DD and 3P% makes the correlation structure even more important, naturally favoring versatile big men who contribute across categories.


How do I calculate variances? Shouldn’t some players be less streaky like Kevin Durant? Would I have to pull their historical data


Analyzed variance calculation strategies for player performance metrics.



Excellent point! You're absolutely right - Kevin Durant is incredibly consistent while someone like Tyler Herro can be streaky. The G-score framework needs player-specific variance, not just population variance. Here's how to calculate it:

The Impact:

A team of consistent players (Durant, Jokic) might show 55% win probability
A team of streaky players (Poole, Herro) might show 52% win probability
Even with the same average stats!
This is why the G-score framework is superior - it correctly values consistency, which matters enormously in H2H leagues where you need to win individual weeks, not just have good season totals.

### 5. Why the Distributions Show No Overlap

Looking at the visualization (`category_distributions.png`):

**3PM Distribution:**
- Team Boricua Squad: Peaks at ~35 threes
- KL2 LLC: Peaks at ~55 threes
- **ZERO overlap** - KL2 LLC has more volume shooters

**PTS Distribution:**
- Team Boricua Squad: 300-450 range
- KL2 LLC: 450-600 range
- **ZERO overlap** - Massive depth advantage

**REB Distribution:**
- Team Boricua Squad: ~120-140 range
- KL2 LLC: ~145-175 range
- **Minimal overlap** - AD + Vucevic are elite rebounders

When 3-4 categories have 0% or near-0% win rates, and you need to win 6 out of 11 categories, the math correctly produces 95%+ win probability for the dominant team.

## Mathematical Validation

From 500 simulations:
- KL2 LLC won: 477 times (95.4%)
- Team Boricua Squad won: 13 times (2.6%)
- Ties: 10 times (2.0%)

The 13 wins for Team Boricua Squad occurred when:
1. They won their 3 strong categories (FG%, BLK, TO)
2. They got lucky in 3-4 more categories (FT%, 3P%, AST, STL, or DD)
3. This happened only 2.6% of the time due to the massive gaps

---

## Conclusion

**The 95.4% win probability is mathematically correct, NOT overconfident.**

The primary issue is that Team Boricua Squad has 5 players marked as OUT, including what appear to be significant contributors (Paul George, Jalen Williams, Josh Hart, Keegan Murray). This gives KL2 LLC a 50% advantage in player-games (36 vs 24).

If those players were healthy and modeled, this matchup would be much closer. For example:
- Adding Paul George (~20 ppg, 5 reb, 4 ast)
- Adding Jalen Williams (~18 ppg, 4 reb, 5 ast)
- Adding Josh Hart (~12 ppg, 8 reb, 4 ast)
- Adding Keegan Murray (~13 ppg, 6 reb, 2 ast)

Would add ~150+ points, ~60+ rebounds, ~40+ assists per week, dramatically closing the gap.

## Recommendations

1. **Injury Handling**: Consider how to handle OUT players in projections. Options:
   - Mark these matchups as "incomplete" due to injury uncertainty
   - Use replacement-level assumptions for OUT players
   - Add injury probability weighting

2. **Confidence Intervals**: Add confidence bands to projections that account for:
   - Number of modeled players on each team
   - Variance in category outcomes
   - Quality of data (historical vs projection-based)

3. **Validation**: The simulation methodology is working correctly. The high confidence is due to legitimate roster disparities, not a modeling flaw.

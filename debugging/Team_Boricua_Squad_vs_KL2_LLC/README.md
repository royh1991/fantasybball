| BLK | 56.4% | ✓ Slight edge |
| FT% | 36.4% | Loses |
| STL | 19.4% | Rarely wins |

## Variance Analysis

### Team Weekly Standard Deviations
- **Team Boricua Squad:** PTS σ=19.3, REB σ=11.7, AST σ=8.6
- **KL2 LLC:** PTS σ=23.7, REB σ=11.7, AST σ=9.6

Despite having randomness in the simulations, the means are so far apart that the distributions rarely overlap.

### Top Player Variability (Individual Games)
- **Luka Doncic:** 34.5 ± 5.8 ppg (10th-90th percentile: 27-42)
- **Anthony Davis:** 23.8 ± 5.0 ppg (10th-90th percentile: 18-30)
- **Nikola Vucevic:** 22.2 ± 4.8 ppg (10th-90th percentile: 16-29)

Even accounting for game-to-game variance, KL2 LLC has more depth at every position.

## Why the 95.4% Confidence is Correct

### Mathematical Explanation

To win a matchup, you need to win 6 out of 11 categories.

**Team Boricua Squad has:**
- 3 categories they win >50% of the time (FG%, BLK, TO)
- 8 categories they win <50% of the time
- 3 categories they **never** win (3PM, PTS, REB)

**For Team Boricua Squad to win, they need:**
1. Win all 3 of their strong categories (FG%, BLK, TO)
2. Win 3 more categories from the remaining 8

**Probability calculation:**
- P(win FG%) = 0.664
- P(win BLK) = 0.564
- P(win TO) = 0.928
- P(win all 3) ≈ 0.347 (34.7%)

Then, from the remaining 8 categories with win rates of {0.364, 0.154, 0.166, 0.194, 0.128, 0.04, 0.0, 0.0}, they need to win exactly 3.

The probability of this happening is extremely low because:
- 2 categories have 0% win rate
- 4 categories have <20% win rate
- Only 2 categories have >10% win rate

**Result:** Even when Team Boricua Squad wins their 3 strong categories (35% of simulations), they rarely win 3 more from the weak categories → overall win rate = 2.6%.

---

## Conclusion

The 95.4% win probability for KL2 LLC is **mathematically correct** and reflects:

1. **50% more player-games** (36 vs 24)
2. **40% more points** (523 vs 375)
3. **Zero overlap** in 3 key categories (3PM, PTS, REB)
4. **Depth advantage** at every position (12 vs 8 players)

The simulation methodology is working correctly. The high confidence is due to a legitimate roster mismatch, primarily driven by Team Boricua Squad having 5 OUT players (including stars like Paul George, Jalen Williams, and Josh Hart).

If those players were healthy and added to the model, this matchup would be significantly closer.
